## Inspiration
As software engineers, we are always looking for ways to make people's lives easier and more convenient. Fiesta was born out of the need for a better event planning experience. Many event coordinators have faced the common problem of uncertainty of attendance and lack of a streamlined registration process. After hearing stories and experiences of these struggles, we knew there had to be a better solution. That's why we created Fiesta, an app that allows for easy registration and eliminates the guesswork involved in event planning, giving event coordinators the information they need to plan events seamlessly and efficiently.

## What it does
Fiesta is an event planning app that streamlines the process of organizing and registering events. It allows users to easily plan and create events by setting the date, location and other details. It also provides a simple registration process for attendees. With Fiesta, event coordinators can have a clear understanding of attendance and can plan accordingly, eliminating the guesswork and uncertainty involved in event planning. The app also allows for easy communication and sharing of event details, including date and location, making the planning process seamless and efficient for everyone involved

## How we built it
Javascript, React, Material UI, Firebase, ExpressJs, Socket.io

## Challenges we ran into
Developing Fiesta was not without its challenges. One of the biggest challenges we faced was that not all members of the team were experienced in the technologies we were using. However, we were able to work together and help each other out, with some team members quickly learning how to build with Material UI and figure out how to use Auth0 authentication. Another challenge was managing version control as we were constantly making changes and updating the codebase, but we were able to overcome this by implementing strict version control protocols and frequent code reviews. Despite these challenges, we were able to come together as a team and create a successful and user-friendly event planning app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are incredibly proud of the accomplishments we have made with Fiesta. One of the biggest accomplishments we are proud of is creating a fully functional full stack application involving frontend, backend, and database. It was a challenging task but we were able to successfully bring it together and make an intuitive and user-friendly event planning app. Another accomplishment we are proud of is successfully deploying the project, making it accessible to users worldwide.

## What we learned
Developing Fiesta has been a valuable learning experience for our team. We've learned how to work together effectively in a team environment, how to overcome challenges and how to build a functional and user-friendly full stack web application. We've also learned how to use a variety of technologies such as Material UI and Auth0 authentication, which helped us to improve our skills and knowledge. Additionally, we've learned how to manage version control and how to deploy the application successfully. Overall, this project has helped us to become better developers and has taught us valuable skills that will serve us well in our future projects.

## What's next for Fiesta Finder
Fiesta is just getting started and we have many plans for its future. One of the things we are currently working on is adding Twilio to give push notifications for reminders about upcoming events, and notifications when event details are changed. This will make it even more convenient for users to stay on top of their event planning. Additionally, we are planning to add more features such as a calendar view to help users keep track of events, and a payment gateway to make it easier for users to purchase tickets and register for events. We are also exploring adding a feature that allows users to create custom surveys to gather feedback after the event. We are excited to continue improving and expanding the capabilities of Fiesta to make it an even more powerful tool for event planners everywhere.
